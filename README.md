## General info

A custumized 3d graphical engine using Opengl , C and C++ 

## Credits 
This project has been contributed by the help of my second year computer graphic lecturer Huang Xiaping 黄鲜萍 for the guidance ,review and recommandation .Tony gray ,Computer Graphics & Animation lecturer at the University of tasmania  as autor of the shaders , support folder .

## Content 
This project is a combination of : 
* 9 complex object class 
* 4 complex object have animated childs 
* 1 skybox 
* 20 object present in the space 
* 2 ogg files 
* Camera scene control

## Technologies
Project was created with:
* Opengl version : 4.6
* Visual studio 2019 : 1.41
* C++: 14

## Project objectives
this project will give a better understanding about : 

* provide an arsenal of visual development tools
* learning the abstraction and and computational thinking 
* better understanding about the homogeneous representation , matrix operation .
* usage of GLUT / GLFW .
* understanding the platfrom specific utility functions ,system timer interfaces , texture loading and sound support 
* usage of interpolated shading , Opengl lighting model , texture mapping and filtering 
* updating attributes of created objects such as position orientation , colour for animation purposes .
* terrain / spaces creation 
* good understanding about the hierarchical structure concept

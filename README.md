## Setup


	
## Technologies
Project was created with:
* Opengl version : 3.7.2
* Visual studio code : J2SE-1.5
* C++: 3.35.3

## Project objectives
this project will give a better understanding about : 

* provide an arsenal of visual development tools
* learning the abstraction and and computational thinking 
* better understanding about the homogeneous representation , matrix operation .
* usage of GLUT / GLFW .
* understanding the platfrom specific utility functions ,system timer interfaces , texture loading and sound support 
* usage of interpolated shading , Opengl lighting model , texture mapping and filtering 
* updating attributes of created objects such as position orientation , colour for animation purposes .
* terrain / spaces creation 
* good understanding about the hierarchical structure concept
